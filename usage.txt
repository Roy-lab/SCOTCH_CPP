Usage:
./run_nmtf <tree file> <number of features> <ucomponent> <vcomponent> <optional arguments>

Example:
./run_mmtf input/toy_tree.txt 120 2 -o output/

Input tree file format:
======= example ========
1 3 A input/toy/A.txt 95
2 3 B input/toy/B.txt 80
3 -1 root N/A N/A
========================
- Column 1: node ID; start from 1 and move up.
- Column 2: parent node ID; right now the implementation will only 
	work correctly if you ID all children nodes before a parent node 
	(so start from the lowest depth of tree, move to next level, till 
	you hit the root, which should be the last node ID.)
- Column 3: node alias, used as prefix to U and V output files.
- Column 4: location of input matrix file for leaf nodes, relative 
	to where the run_tmf executable is. Set as N/A for non-leaf nodes.
- Column 5: number of samples/data points/rows in each input matrix; 
	Set as N/A for non-leaf nodes.

Input matrix file format:
- Tab-delimited "dense" matrix text files.
- Each column represents a feature (e.g. gene); each row represents 
	a data point (e.g. cell).
- All input matrix files listed in the tree file should have the same 
	number of features/columns (they can have different number of rows 
	or data points).

Output files:
- [leaf]_U.txt and [leaf]_V.txt for each leaf node; [leaf] will be
	replaced with the node's alias.
- [node]_V.txt for each internal node and the root node; [node] will
	be replaced with the node's alias.

Optional arguments:
-o <output file prefix>
	If <ouput file prefix> = output/ then output files will be 
	saved to output directory (note: will NOT create a directory 
	if it does not exist). By default output will be saved to 
	current directory.
-a <alpha>
	If <alpha> = 100, sets alpha (strength of tree regularization)
	to 100. Default is alpha = 10.
-l <lambda>
	If <lambda> = 200, sets lambda (strength of sparsity constraint)
	to 200. Default is lambda = 0, no sparsity constraint.
-s
	Run in slient mode, nothing printed to stdout. By default, 
	error/objective value at each iteration is printed, and the
	total run time and max RAM usage is printed at the end.
-r <random state>
	Random state/seed used for rNNDSVD initialization. Default
	random state = 1010. 
-t <tol>
	If <tol> = 10, the algorithm will keep iterating until the
	absolute difference between the previous iteration's error
	and current iteration's error is less than 10. By default,
	tol = 1.
-m <max iter>
	If <max iter> = 200, the algorithm will terminate at 200
	iterations if it has not coverged based on the tolerance (tol)
	parameter by then. By default, max iter = 300.
-h
	Print this manual to screen.
